we need to alter it so that we pass in the hive_trx_ids of the card_uid (and maybe the card_uid?), into a searchable object (key: value pair, we can have the value be true), and so when we're looking over records to add, we just end up only adding any records that actually need to be patched, and so it can be added to the overall records we're gonna patch, rather than essentially just discarded (currently we take literally everything).
